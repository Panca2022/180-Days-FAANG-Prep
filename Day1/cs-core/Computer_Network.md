# Computer Networking

## Introduction to Networking

- A network is a set of connected devices (nodes) through communication links (edges).
- Components:
  - Node: Any device capable of sending and/or receiving data (e.g., computers, printers).
  - Edge: A communication channel connecting the nodes.
- Networking helps distribute tasks across multiple systems, avoiding overloading a single device.

## What is Computer Networking?

- A computer network is a group of computers connected using a communication medium (wired or wireless).
- Enables resource sharing, data transfer, and collaborative processing.

## Components of a Computer Network

### 1. NIC (Network Interface Card)

- Allows a device to communicate with other devices on a network.
- Contains a hardware (MAC) address used by the data link layer.
- Types:
  - Wireless NIC: Used in modern laptops via antennas and radio waves.
  - Wired NIC: Transfers data over cables.

### 2. Switch

- Groups devices in a network.
- Does not broadcast to all; sends data only to the intended device.
- Improves bandwidth efficiency.

### 3. Modem

- Connects computers to the internet via telephone lines.
- Not integrated into the motherboard; exists as a separate component.

### 4. Router

- Connects LANs to the internet.
- Routes data between different networks.
- Enables multiple devices to share a single internet connection.

### 5. Cables and Connectors

Used to transmit communication signals.
- Twisted Pair Cable: Cost-effective, supports speeds â‰¥ 1 Gbps.
- Coaxial Cable: More expensive but offers higher transmission quality.
- Fiber Optic Cable: Transmits data as light, offering the fastest and highest bandwidth.

### 6. Hub

- Central device that broadcasts data to all connected devices.
- Unlike a switch, it does not filter or direct traffic, leading to possible inefficiency.

## Benefits of Computer Networking

- Security: Restricts unauthorized access; users have limited permissions.
- Problem Solving: Distributed systems can solve tasks faster than a single machine.
- Redundancy: Multiple systems running the same program ensures fault tolerance and continuity.

## Applications of Computer Networks

- Resource Sharing: Devices (printers, storage, etc.) can be accessed by multiple computers.
- Client-Server Model: One device (server) provides resources or data; another (client) consumes it.
- Communication: Enables real-time messaging, email, video calls, etc.
