# 180-Days FAANG Prep 🚀👩‍💻

Welcome to my 180-day journey to crack FAANG interviews as a **MERN Stack Developer**!  
This repository is a structured daily log of my learning across full-stack development, DSA, system design, CS fundamentals, and interview preparation.

## 📅 Daily Structure

Each day is divided into 3 core learning modules, with additional support sections weekly:

### 🔹 1. MERN Stack Development
